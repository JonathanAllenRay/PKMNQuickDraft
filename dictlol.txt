[{'format': 'PU', 'overview': "<p>Articuno carves itself a good niche in the PU metagame, as it has good offenses, respectable bulk, a useful ability in Pressure, and a decent Speed tier. These traits allow Articuno to run effective offensive and defensive sets, capable of breaking weaker teams or stalling out defensive threats such as Audino. Articuno's good bulk also allows it to blanket check many offensive Pokemon like Victreebel, Skuntank, and Swanna and deal with them with its STAB moves in return. However, Articuno does have a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its opportunities to switch in freely. As a result, Articuno must be partnered with a teammate that can remove entry hazards. In addition, Articuno's poor defensive typing prevents it from being a fully defensive wall, and its average offenses make it too weak to be a fully offensive sweeper. Articuno competes with other Ice-types in the tier, namely Aurorus, Jynx, and Abomasnow, all of which are more versatile and stronger offensively. Despite outspeeding the likes of Skuntank and Stoutland, Articuno sits in a slightly awkward Speed tier, leaving it outpaced by common threats like Kangaskhan, Primeape, and Dodrio. Finally, Articuno has trouble in some matchups versus more offensively based teams, as it can be more easily pressured by strong wallbreakers. Those teams also tend to set up Stealth Rock more easily and are able to apply more pressure to the hazard remover.</p>\n", 'comments': "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 Spe can be used, at the expense of power, to have a better chance of keeping its Substitute intact from weak attacks like defensive Qwilfish's Waterfall and specially offensive Skuntank's Dark Pulse.

If using Articuno early-game, keep in mind that it commonly draws in Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Aggron; therefore, it is capable of luring in and KOing such Pokemon with Hidden Power Fighting after Supersonic Skystrike. Articuno struggles to break counters such as Type: Null and Cryogonal due to their bulk and recovery, so it's advised to double switch to checks to these Pokemon to pressure or eliminate them. Articuno is susceptible to being worn down by Stealth Rock and weaker attacks from the likes of Froslass, Jellicent, and Roselia.

Articuno also appreciates Kabutops pressuring Fire-types as well as Lycanroc. Similarly, Articuno benefits from teammates such as Mudsdale and Poliwrath, which can switch into Rock-type attacks aimed its way. Mudsdale also provides Stealth Rock support, which aids Articuno in wallbreaking. Despite Articuno's good coverage, it struggles to break blanket special walls such as Audino, Type: Null, and Assault Vest Eelektross, as well as Rock-types like Regirock and Lycanroc. Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Primeape put immense pressure on them; additionally, Primeape can safely bring Articuno into battle with U-turn. In return, Articuno can pressure Pokemon such as Tangela and Mudsdale for them. Stoutland and Choice Band Dodrio appreciate Articuno's ability to weaken or remove Steel-types like Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, enabling them to spam their STAB attacks more freely.

It is also the key component to stalling out the foe's PP. Roost is Articuno's reliable source of recovery that keeps it healthy throughout the match and also allows Articuno to continue using Substitute. Freeze-Dry is Articuno's primary STAB move and has super effective coverage on Water-types like Lanturn and Floatzel. Hurricane is its other STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Jynx and is stronger than Freeze-Dry at the expense of accuracy.</p>\n<h1>Set Details</h1>\n<p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Articuno to outrun Pokemon like Stoutland and Skuntank. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Articuno hit as hard as possible. Pressure allows Articuno to whittle the foe's PP much faster and stall out moves. Leftovers gives Articuno passive recovery and helps it set up more Substitutes.</p>\n<h1>Usage Tips</h1>\n<p>Send out Articuno as early as possible if the opponent does not have a direct counter to it, such as Metang, Probopass, or Type: Null. Since Articuno's offensive coverage is very threatening, don't hesitate to simply attack if the opponent cannot switch into its Ice- or Flying- coverage well. Switch Articuno into passive Pokemon or Pokemon that don't threaten it offensively, such as Clefairy, but be cautious of status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Then, set up Substitute or just attack without a Substitute if they are within range of being KOed. Repeatedly set up Substitute against foes that are slower and have moves with low PP in order to stall them out, such as Regirock's Stone Edge. Use Roost when moves have either run out of PP or have missed. Avoid switching in Articuno when Stealth Rock is on the field unless absolutely necessary. If it must switch in, it should almost always use Roost to recover, though this makes it lose momentum, makes it vulnerable to attacks or status, or gives the opponent a free switch. Articuno is best used as a Pokemon that breaks down the opponent's team for teammates to sweep, so focus primarily on chipping and whittling down the foes rather than sweeping late-game on its own.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock means entry hazard control is required. Therefore, hazard removers like Hitmonchan, Skuntank, and Lurantis are mandatory. Hitmonchan is notable, as it can take on many strong special attacking Fire- and Electric-types such as Combusken and Eelektross. Articuno appreciates answers to Steel-type Pokemon, most notably Alolan Sandslash and Aggron, so offensive Ground- and Fighting-types such as Golurk, Primeape, and Gurdurr are good partners. In return, Articuno can help pressure Pokemon like Tangela and Clefairy that serve as defensive checks to them. Fire-types like Simisear and Combusken check Articuno well, so Articuno welcomes checks to them such as Regirock and Lanturn. In return, Articuno can beat Ground- and Ice-types, like Mudsdale and Jynx, that threaten them. Pokemon that take on Electric-types, such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, Type: Null, and Eelektross, are also appreciated. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Regirock and Clefairy chips Articuno's checks and counters and helps it beat them more easily. Pivots, namely slow U-turn and Volt Switch users like Eelektross, Lanturn, and Type: Null, can help Articuno come in more safely. Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Lycanroc, Carracosta, and Gurdurr appreciate Articuno's ability to stall out and break down walls for them. Wallbreakers like Stoutland, Drampa, and Aggron that break through defensive Pokemon that Articuno can't stall out, namely Type: Null, are appreciated.</p>\n", 'abilities': ['Pressure'], 'items': ['Leftovers'], 'moveslots': [[{'move': 'Substitute', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Roost', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Freeze-Dry', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Hurricane', 'type': None}]], 'evconfigs': [{'hp': 0, 'atk': 0, 'def': 0, 'spa': 252, 'spd': 4, 'spe': 252}], 'ivconfigs': [], 'natures': ['Timid']}, {'name': 'Specially Defensive', 'pokemon': 'Articuno', 'shiny': False, 'gender': 'DC', 'level': 0, 'description': "<h1>Moves</h1>\n<p>Defog supports not only Articuno's teammates but also itself, as steering its side clear of Stealth Rock is an integral part of keeping Articuno healthy. Articuno will have many chances to make use of this move thanks to its ability to switch into many common entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Roselia with little to no risk. Freeze-Dry is Articuno's Ice-type STAB attack with added coverage on Water-type Pokemon, punishing Qwilfish, Lanturn, and Carracosta. Heal Bell cures Articuno and its teammates of status conditions. Alternatively, Toxic is a staple on the bulkier and stall teams that Articuno best fits in as a top-notch option for wearing down defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Substitute takes advantage of Articuno's Pressure against Pokemon by reliably stalling out moves like Regirock's Stone Edge or Rock Slide and Aggron's Head Smash. Haze is a unique choice that negates stat boosts, which is particularly notable for disrupting Calm Mind users such as Spiritomb and Clefairy throughout the match.</p>\n<h1>Set Details</h1>\n<p>Pressure allows Articuno to stall out crucial moves from opposing Pokemon to alleviate pressure for the rest of the team. Leftovers gradually restores Articuno's HP and, with Roost, makes Articuno as durable as possible. 248 HP EVs and 208 EVs in Special Defense provide Articuno with great special bulk, notably allowing it to always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Blizzard from Aurorus after Stealth Rock damage and safely Roost off the damage afterward. 56 Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed Modest Jellicent and Jolly Aggron, letting it PP stall or beat them with Roost, Substitute, or Freeze-Dry, respectively. Outspeeding Aurorus is noteworthy as well; Articuno can use Roost first to gain a resistance to its Ice-type STAB attacks and reduce its Rock weakness, allowing it to tank subsequent hits and stall out Aurorus's limited PP with ease.</p>\n<h1>Usage Tips</h1>\n<p>One must keep track of the PP of moves of opposing Pokemon that Articuno can be in a position to stall, as this is effectively Articuno's way to secure a win for its team, whether it's through stalling out Aggron's Head Smash or Clefairy's Moonblast PP. Articuno can also stall a single Pokemon out of all its Toxic PP, which is great for dealing with individual users like Clefairy. Otherwise, Articuno should prioritize utilizing Pressure by proactively switching into Stealth Rock users and other hazard users that can't directly threaten it like Clefairy and Qwilfish and removing them with ease. The threat of Freeze-Dry deters Qwilfish enough to force it out as opposed to Taunting, so this can be used to Articuno's advantage. If the opponent already manages to have Stealth Rock out on the field, it is highly advised to rely on the secondary remover to clear them out on the field instead of recklessly switching Articuno in to remove them. Utilize options like Heal Bell or Substitute to deal with potential status ailments. If using Heal Bell, Articuno should directly switch into Toxic users that can't threaten it, as with Pressure it can win the PP war against any individual Toxic user. Articuno should keep itself as healthy as possible with Roost, as it can act as a secondary pivot into strong special attackers when teammates like Audino are weakened, such as against Drampa, Ludicolo, and Jellicent. It can also use Haze to stop a variety of forms of setup from Pokemon like Lurantis and Calm Mind Clefairy.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Articuno is specialized on stall-oriented teams as a staple option for entry hazard control thanks to its reliable recovery, its great bulk, and the great options it has for supporting its teammates. Despite it acting as a Defogger, separate hazard control remains vital alongside it to maintain its longevity due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Skuntank and Altaria are notable picks, with the former being great for bulky teams that need a Toxic Spikes absorber while also a decent check to stallbreakers like Oricorio-G. Altaria offers good support with its utility and reliability as a Defogger and is able to come in more safely against Eelektross and Combusken and remove hazards. As this set is meant to be used on stall teams, standard stall staples such as Audino and Clefairy are expected to be run alongside it, as they form a core that is vital in providing recovery, Wish passing, spreading Toxic, and blanket checking a majority of threats. These three Pokemon can also all alternate their support options based on the team's needs. Physical tanks such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Tangela can be quite effective in taking on physical attackers such as Stoutland, Aggron, Lycanroc, and Alolan Raticate. These Pokemon, in general, also appreciate Articuno's ability to check Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type special attackers like Poliwrath, Aurorus, and Bellossom.</p>\n", 'abilities': ['Pressure'], 'items': ['Leftovers'], 'moveslots': [[{'move': 'Roost', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Defog', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Freeze-Dry', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Heal Bell', 'type': None}, {'move': 'Toxic', 'type': None}, {'move': 'Substitute', 'type': None}]], 'evconfigs': [{'hp': 248, 'atk': 0, 'def': 0, 'spa': 0, 'spd': 204, 'spe': 56}], 'ivconfigs': [], 'natures': ['Calm']}], 'credits': {'teams': [{'name': 'Quality checked by', 'members': [{'user_id': 202117, 'username': 'Megazard'}, {'user_id': 247045, 'username': 'Twix'}, {'user_id': 252106, 'username': 'yogi'}, {'user_id': 355061, 'username': 'UberSkitty'}, {'user_id': 400292, 'username': 'allstarapology'}, {'user_id': 442732, 'username': 'tondas'}, {'user_id': 434150, 'username': 'gum'}]}, {'name': 'Grammar checked by', 'members': [{'user_id': 384270, 'username': 'martha'}, {'user_id': 302985, 'username': 'lotiasite'}, {'user_id': 232216, 'username': 'The Dutch Plumberjack'}, {'user_id': 168392, 'username': 'P Squared'}, {'user_id': 331519, 'username': 'CryoGyro'}, {'user_id': 240732, 'username': 'Estronic'}]}], 'writtenBy': [{'user_id': 310340, 'username': 'Slowbroth'}, {'user_id': 424692, 'username': 'jklioe'}, {'user_id': 336073, 'username': 'Rabia'}]}}, {'format': 'UU', 'overview': "<p>Articuno's ability to compress roles as both a Defog user and a Heal Bell user allows it to carve a niche on stall teams as a specially bulky support Pokemon, capable of removing entry hazards against Pokemon like Hippowdon, Empoleon, and Nidoking. Pressure is also one of Articuno's most useful traits, allowing it to stall out moves like Stealth Rock and Toxic, making it hard for the opponent to spread residual damage around the team, which any bulky build would appreciate. On top of this, Articuno is able to sponge hits from very strong special attackers like Hydreigon, Mega Blastoise, and Nidoking thanks to its incredibly high Special Defense stat and overall bulk. Articuno also possesses a decent Speed tier for a bulky Pokemon, which gives it the opportunity to outspeed and potentially remove Pokemon like Crawdaunt and Primarina with the right EV investment. Despite this, Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock makes it hard for it to come into play all the time and perform its role, meaning it mandates a lot more team support than most other Pokemon. Its subpar defensive typing also holds it back, providing it with only two resistances and an immunity to Ground-type attacks, aggravating its difficulty to come into play and making it weak to common offensive threats like Scizor, Mega Aerodactyl, and Cobalion. Furthermore, Pokemon like Mega Aggron and Nihilego can easily set up Stealth Rock and prevent Articuno from coming in and using Defog as well. Although Articuno is able to compress roles by running both Defog and Heal Bell on its set, it still faces heavy competition as a Defogger from Pokemon like Moltres, which has a much better defensive typing and consequently a relatively easier time finding an opportunity to Defog.

Articuno will come out on top most of the time, as it can PP stall their moves with Pressure, preventing the former two from being able to pressure it with Toxic. However, this comes at the cost of Articuno having to expense all of its Heal Bell PP to Pressure stall Toxic, which can leave it susceptible to status from other users, so Heal Bell should be used conservatively where possible. However, Articuno shouldn't be switching in when Stealth Rock is already up, as it will take a lot of damage. Instead, it's best to use a different Pokemon like Gligar to remove it first, if feasible. It's also encouraged to take advantage of Pressure and switch into moves like Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Defog as often as possible in order to stall out their PP and consequently make it harder for the opponent to continually damage the team. Roost should be used proactively, as keeping Articuno as healthy as possible is extremely important, in case it's forced to come into play while Stealth Rock is up. Due to its high Special Defense stat, Articuno can also be used to sponge special attacks from Pokemon like Primarina and Starmie if necessary. Be aware of and scout for coverage moves such as Krookodile's Stone Edge that could be aimed at Articuno, as they could either OHKO it or leave it at a very low amount of HP. Watch out for Heal Bell's PP, since it can run out very quickly, and defensive teams heavily rely on cleric support in order to succeed.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Articuno fits best on stall teams that appreciate its ability to compress roles as a cleric and a Defogger and shouldn't be used outside of those types of teams due to the specific amount of support it requires. Additional forms of entry hazard removal are a must-have whenever using Articuno, as it often can't keep repeatedly removing hazards by itself due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock and the number of entry hazard setters that match up well against it. Pokemon like Gligar can provide such support. Pokemon that can sponge Rock-type attacks aimed at Articuno like Alomomola, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Aggron pair well with Articuno. The examples given also benefit from Articuno's Heal Bell support. Steel-type checks such as Quagsire, Pyukumuku, and the aforementioned Alomomola also make good partners, as Pokemon like Scizor and Cobalion can prove to be a big nuisance to Articuno. Rocky Helmet Alomomola can also help punish Scizor, which Articuno is vulnerable to giving up momentum to. Wish support from Pokemon like Blissey and Alomomola can be very useful, allowing Articuno to switch into special attackers more easily. It's also useful to minimize any hazard damage that Articuno is forced to take. Blissey is also a fantastic partner, as it has access to Natural Cure, which allows it to pivot into common status users such as Empoleon and as a result lets Articuno conserve its limited number of Heal Bell PP. Bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Mega Slowbro share good synergy with Articuno, as they match up well against most of its checks, such as Mega Aerodactyl, Infernape, and Terrakion. In return, Articuno can keep Grass-types like Amoonguss in check and provide Heal Bell support. Electric-immune Pokemon such as Gligar and specially defensive walls like Blissey also pair well with Articuno, as Pokemon like Zeraora and Mega Manectric can threaten it a lot. Mega Aerodactyl makes a great partner for Articuno, as it can alleviate its weakeness to giving threats such as Infernape too many setup opportunities and easily revenge kill them. Mega Aerodactyl can also deal with the aforementioned Electric-types that threaten Articuno and provide Pursuit support to deal with problematic threats such as Latias and Celebi that have the ability to break past Articuno. In return, Mega Aerodactyl appreciates Articuno's ability to keep Stealth Rock off the field and provide it with Heal Bell support.</p>\n", 'abilities': ['Pressure'], 'items': ['Leftovers'], 'moveslots': [[{'move': 'Defog', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Heal Bell', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Freeze-Dry', 'type': None}], [{'move': 'Roost', 'type': None}]], 'evconfigs': [{'hp': 248, 'atk': 0, 'def': 4, 'spa': 0, 'spd': 160, 'spe': 96}], 'ivconfigs': [], 'natures': ['Calm']}], 'credits': {'teams': [{'name': 'Quality checked by', 'members': [{'user_id': 313384, 'username': 'Hilomilo'}, {'user_id': 384270, 'username': 'martha'}, {'user_id': 382658, 'username': 'Nuked'}]}, {'name': 'Grammar checked by', 'members': [{'user_id': 302985, 'username': 'lotiasite'}, {'user_id': 232216, 'username': 'The Dutch Plumberjack'}]}], 'writtenBy': [{'user_id': 347604, 'username': 'Surgeon'}]}}, {'format': 'RU', 'overview': "<p>Articuno is an excellent support Pokemon on stall and balance teams due to its access to the rare Pressure, which allows it to keep Stealth Rock off the field against passive users of the move, such as Registeel and Palossand, while its great defensive stats let it act as a blanket check to various offensive entry hazard setters like Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Golisopod. Articuno is also excellent at stalling out common defensive cores due to its ability to avoid status through Heal Bell or Substitute and burn through the foe's PP.  Articuno's ability to break common cores can allow it to support more offensive teammates and helps mitigate its issues with passivity.

Freeze-Dry is a reliable STAB move that lets Articuno beat Water-types like Blastoise easily. Its high PP should also be noted, as it allows Articuno to PP stall its targets more easily. Heal Bell lets Articuno act as a cleric for its team as well as beat passive Pokemon that rely on Toxic for damage, such as Registeel or Cresselia. This move is particularly useful on stall teams, where Articuno cannot afford to be statused on the switch. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to help Articuno PP stall moves such as Stone Edge from Rhyperior and Power Gem from Diancie, as well as avoid status, although it makes Articuno more vulnerable to being statused on the switch.

Pressure immensely aids Articuno in PP stalling several moves such as Toxic and Stealth Rock.</p>\n<h1>Usage Tips</h1>\n<p>It's important to have the field clear of entry hazards before sending Articuno out. If the opponent's entry hazard setters are walled by Articuno, hard switch it into them to prevent having to take Stealth Rock damage and use Defog to remove them afterwards. Heal Bell variants have a lot more leeway against Toxic users like Registeel; with Pressure, it has enough PP to stall out a single Pokemon's Toxic. If running Substitute, try to predict whether the opponent will try to use Toxic against Articuno as it switches in, as it is heavily crippled if statused. Preserve Heal Bell's PP as much as possible; for example, switch to a Steel-type on a predicted Toxic. While Articuno can beat a single Toxic user one-on-one, multiple users of the move can overwhelm Articuno teams with little trouble. If Stealth Rock has been set up on the field already, avoid using Articuno to remove it unless absolutely necessary. Try to use Articuno's teammates first, or position your team to force the opponent to use Defog themselves. Pressure can be used to stall through a specific threat, but Articuno can also be switched into moves throughout the match to slowly stall out their PP, especially against moves such as Defog, Toxic, and Scald.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Articuno is a good choice on bulky teams like stall and balance. As such, Pokemon commonly found in these archetypes generally work well with it; staples like Milotic, Registeel, and Mandibuzz, for example, synergize well with Articuno. While Articuno is an excellent Defogger, it won't be consistent if it is the sole entry hazard remover in a team due to the existence of Pokemon like Rhyperior and Metagross. Other removers like Mandibuzz and Donphan can keep entry hazards off the field against these Pokemon. Articuno is setup bait for many dangerous offensive Pokemon, so bulky teammates like Donphan, Bronzong, and Pyukumuku can help mitigate its weak offense matchup.
