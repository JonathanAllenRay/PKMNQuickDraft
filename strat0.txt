{"format": "PU", "overview": "<p>Articuno carves itself a good niche in the PU metagame, as it has good offenses, respectable bulk, a useful ability in Pressure, and a decent Speed tier. These traits allow Articuno to run effective offensive and defensive sets, capable of breaking weaker teams or stalling out defensive threats such as Audino. Articuno's good bulk also allows it to blanket check many offensive Pokemon like Victreebel, Skuntank, and Swanna and deal with them with its STAB moves in return. However, Articuno does have a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, which limits its opportunities to switch in freely. As a result, Articuno must be partnered with a teammate that can remove entry hazards. In addition, Articuno's poor defensive typing prevents it from being a fully defensive wall, and its average offenses make it too weak to be a fully offensive sweeper. Articuno competes with other Ice-types in the tier, namely Aurorus, Jynx, and Abomasnow, all of which are more versatile and stronger offensively. Despite outspeeding the likes of Skuntank and Stoutland, Articuno sits in a slightly awkward Speed tier, leaving it outpaced by common threats like Kangaskhan, Primeape, and Dodrio. Finally, Articuno has trouble in some matchups versus more offensively based teams, as it can be more easily pressured by strong wallbreakers. Those teams also tend to set up Stealth Rock more easily and are able to apply more pressure to the hazard remover.</p>\n", "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1>\n<p>A spread of 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 Spe can be used, at the expense of power, to have a better chance of keeping its Substitute intact from weak attacks like defensive Qwilfish's Waterfall and specially offensive Skuntank's Dark Pulse. An Agility + Flyinium Z set can be a threatening late-game sweeper but can be tricky to pull off because it is still often too weak offensively to sweep unless all of its checks and counters have been eliminated or severely weakened.</p>\n<h1>Checks and Counters</h1>\n<p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Articuno loses almost half of its health when switching into Stealth Rock, which limits its longevity and defensive capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Alolan Sandslash, Metang, and Aggron all threaten Articuno with their STAB move while walling defensive Articuno entirely. Alolan Sandslash and Aggron have to be wary of Hidden Power Fighting from offensive Articuno.</p>\n<p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats</strong>: Pokemon such as Alolan Dugtrio, Alolan Raichu, and Lycanroc are all capable of utilizing their advantageous offensive typing and strength to OHKO or 2HKO Articuno.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Pokemon like Type: Null and Audino can take on Articuno's average offensive stats. The former can set up on it and beat it one-on-one, while the latter can lock Articuno into a move via Encore and switch out to an appropriate teammate. However, Audino must resort to PP stalling Articuno to truly beat it.</p>\n", "movesets": [{"name": "3 Attacks + Roost", "pokemon": "Articuno", "shiny": false, "gender": "DC", "level": 0, "description": "<h1>Moves</h1>\n<p>Freeze-Dry is preferred over other Ice-type attacks so that Articuno can reliably damage Water-types like Lanturn, Jellicent, and Omastar. Hidden Power Fighting targets Steel- and Rock-types such as Alolan Sandslash, Aggron, and Aurorus.</p>\n<h1>Set Details</h1>\n<p>Flyinium Z grants Articuno a perfectly accurate Flying-type nuke that lets it easily dispatch of threats such as Skuntank, Stoutland, and Hitmonchan without having to risk missing Hurricane.</p>\n<h1>Usage Tips</h1>\n<p>Articuno is best used mid- to late-game to clean teams once checks such as Regirock, Cryogonal, and Metang have been weakened or removed entirely. If using Articuno early-game, keep in mind that it commonly draws in Steel-types such as Alolan Sandslash and Aggron; therefore, it is capable of luring in and KOing such Pokemon with Hidden Power Fighting after Supersonic Skystrike. Articuno struggles to break counters such as Type: Null and Cryogonal due to their bulk and recovery, so it's advised to double switch to checks to these Pokemon to pressure or eliminate them. Articuno is susceptible to being worn down by Stealth Rock and weaker attacks from the likes of Froslass, Jellicent, and Roselia. Take advantage of its ability to force switches against Pokemon like Gurdurr and Tangela by recovering health with Roost.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Stealth Rock severely limits Articuno's ability to switch in and wallbreak, so entry hazard removal from the likes of Skuntank, Hitmonchan, and Kabutops is required. Articuno also appreciates Kabutops pressuring Fire-types as well as Lycanroc. Similarly, Articuno benefits from teammates such as Mudsdale and Poliwrath, which can switch into Rock-type attacks aimed its way. Mudsdale also provides Stealth Rock support, which aids Articuno in wallbreaking. Despite Articuno's good coverage, it struggles to break blanket special walls such as Audino, Type: Null, and Assault Vest Eelektross, as well as Rock-types like Regirock and Lycanroc. Pokemon such as Gurdurr and Primeape put immense pressure on them; additionally, Primeape can safely bring Articuno into battle with U-turn. In return, Articuno can pressure Pokemon such as Tangela and Mudsdale for them. Stoutland and Choice Band Dodrio appreciate Articuno's ability to weaken or remove Steel-types like Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, enabling them to spam their STAB attacks more freely. In return, the latter two help weaken Regirock.</p>\n", "abilities": ["Pressure"], "items": ["Flyinium Z"], "moveslots": [[{"move": "Hurricane", "type": null}], [{"move": "Freeze-Dry", "type": null}], [{"move": "Hidden Power", "type": "Fighting"}], [{"move": "Roost", "type": null}]], "evconfigs": [{"hp": 0, "atk": 0, "def": 0, "spa": 252, "spd": 4, "spe": 252}], "ivconfigs": [], "natures": ["Timid"]}, {"name": "SubRoost", "pokemon": "Articuno", "shiny": false, "gender": "DC", "level": 0, "description": "<h1>Moves</h1>\n<p>Substitute allows Articuno to buffer weaker attacks and avoid status. It is also the key component to stalling out the foe's PP. Roost is Articuno's reliable source of recovery that keeps it healthy throughout the match and also allows Articuno to continue using Substitute. Freeze-Dry is Articuno's primary STAB move and has super effective coverage on Water-types like Lanturn and Floatzel. Hurricane is its other STAB move that hits Pokemon such as Hitmonchan and Jynx and is stronger than Freeze-Dry at the expense of accuracy.</p>\n<h1>Set Details</h1>\n<p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Articuno to outrun Pokemon like Stoutland and Skuntank. Maximum Special Attack investment lets Articuno hit as hard as possible. Pressure allows Articuno to whittle the foe's PP much faster and stall out moves. Leftovers gives Articuno passive recovery and helps it set up more Substitutes.</p>\n<h1>Usage Tips</h1>\n<p>Send out Articuno as early as possible if the opponent does not have a direct counter to it, such as Metang, Probopass, or Type: Null. Since Articuno's offensive coverage is very threatening, don't hesitate to simply attack if the opponent cannot switch into its Ice- or Flying- coverage well. Switch Articuno into passive Pokemon or Pokemon that don't threaten it offensively, such as Clefairy, but be cautious of status moves such as Toxic and Thunder Wave. Then, set up Substitute or just attack without a Substitute if they are within range of being KOed. Repeatedly set up Substitute against foes that are slower and have moves with low PP in order to stall them out, such as Regirock's Stone Edge. Use Roost when moves have either run out of PP or have missed. Avoid switching in Articuno when Stealth Rock is on the field unless absolutely necessary. If it must switch in, it should almost always use Roost to recover, though this makes it lose momentum, makes it vulnerable to attacks or status, or gives the opponent a free switch. Articuno is best used as a Pokemon that breaks down the opponent's team for teammates to sweep, so focus primarily on chipping and whittling down the foes rather than sweeping late-game on its own.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Articuno's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock means entry hazard control is required. Therefore, hazard removers like Hitmonchan, Skuntank, and Lurantis are mandatory. Hitmonchan is notable, as it can take on many strong special attacking Fire- and Electric-types such as Combusken and Eelektross. Articuno appreciates answers to Steel-type Pokemon, most notably Alolan Sandslash and Aggron, so offensive Ground- and Fighting-types such as Golurk, Primeape, and Gurdurr are good partners. In return, Articuno can help pressure Pokemon like Tangela and Clefairy that serve as defensive checks to them. Fire-types like Simisear and Combusken check Articuno well, so Articuno welcomes checks to them such as Regirock and Lanturn. In return, Articuno can beat Ground- and Ice-types, like Mudsdale and Jynx, that threaten them. Pokemon that take on Electric-types, such as Lanturn, Gastrodon, Type: Null, and Eelektross, are also appreciated. Stealth Rock support from the likes of Regirock and Clefairy chips Articuno's checks and counters and helps it beat them more easily. Pivots, namely slow U-turn and Volt Switch users like Eelektross, Lanturn, and Type: Null, can help Articuno come in more safely. Late-game cleaners and sweepers such as Lycanroc, Carracosta, and Gurdurr appreciate Articuno's ability to stall out and break down walls for them. Wallbreakers like Stoutland, Drampa, and Aggron that break through defensive Pokemon that Articuno can't stall out, namely Type: Null, are appreciated.</p>\n", "abilities": ["Pressure"], "items": ["Leftovers"], "moveslots": [[{"move": "Substitute", "type": null}], [{"move": "Roost", "type": null}], [{"move": "Freeze-Dry", "type": null}], [{"move": "Hurricane", "type": null}]], "evconfigs": [{"hp": 0, "atk": 0, "def": 0, "spa": 252, "spd": 4, "spe": 252}], "ivconfigs": [], "natures": ["Timid"]}, {"name": "Specially Defensive", "pokemon": "Articuno", "shiny": false, "gender": "DC", "level": 0, "description": "<h1>Moves</h1>\n<p>Defog supports not only Articuno's teammates but also itself, as steering its side clear of Stealth Rock is an integral part of keeping Articuno healthy. Articuno will have many chances to make use of this move thanks to its ability to switch into many common entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish and Roselia with little to no risk. Freeze-Dry is Articuno's Ice-type STAB attack with added coverage on Water-type Pokemon, punishing Qwilfish, Lanturn, and Carracosta. Heal Bell cures Articuno and its teammates of status conditions. Alternatively, Toxic is a staple on the bulkier and stall teams that Articuno best fits in as a top-notch option for wearing down defensive and offensive Pokemon alike. Substitute takes advantage of Articuno's Pressure against Pokemon by reliably stalling out moves like Regirock's Stone Edge or Rock Slide and Aggron's Head Smash. Haze is a unique choice that negates stat boosts, which is particularly notable for disrupting Calm Mind users such as Spiritomb and Clefairy throughout the match.</p>\n<h1>Set Details</h1>\n<p>Pressure allows Articuno to stall out crucial moves from opposing Pokemon to alleviate pressure for the rest of the team. Leftovers gradually restores Articuno's HP and, with Roost, makes Articuno as durable as possible. 248 HP EVs and 208 EVs in Special Defense provide Articuno with great special bulk, notably allowing it to always survive a Choice Specs-boosted Blizzard from Aurorus after Stealth Rock damage and safely Roost off the damage afterward. 56 Speed EVs let Articuno outspeed Modest Jellicent and Jolly Aggron, letting it PP stall or beat them with Roost, Substitute, or Freeze-Dry, respectively. Outspeeding Aurorus is noteworthy as well; Articuno can use Roost first to gain a resistance to its Ice-type STAB attacks and reduce its Rock weakness, allowing it to tank subsequent hits and stall out Aurorus's limited PP with ease.</p>\n<h1>Usage Tips</h1>\n<p>One must keep track of the PP of moves of opposing Pokemon that Articuno can be in a position to stall, as this is effectively Articuno's way to secure a win for its team, whether it's through stalling out Aggron's Head Smash or Clefairy's Moonblast PP. Articuno can also stall a single Pokemon out of all its Toxic PP, which is great for dealing with individual users like Clefairy. Otherwise, Articuno should prioritize utilizing Pressure by proactively switching into Stealth Rock users and other hazard users that can't directly threaten it like Clefairy and Qwilfish and removing them with ease. The threat of Freeze-Dry deters Qwilfish enough to force it out as opposed to Taunting, so this can be used to Articuno's advantage. If the opponent already manages to have Stealth Rock out on the field, it is highly advised to rely on the secondary remover to clear them out on the field instead of recklessly switching Articuno in to remove them. Utilize options like Heal Bell or Substitute to deal with potential status ailments. If using Heal Bell, Articuno should directly switch into Toxic users that can't threaten it, as with Pressure it can win the PP war against any individual Toxic user. Articuno should keep itself as healthy as possible with Roost, as it can act as a secondary pivot into strong special attackers when teammates like Audino are weakened, such as against Drampa, Ludicolo, and Jellicent. It can also use Haze to stop a variety of forms of setup from Pokemon like Lurantis and Calm Mind Clefairy.</p>\n<h1>Team Options</h1>\n<p>Articuno is specialized on stall-oriented teams as a staple option for entry hazard control thanks to its reliable recovery, its great bulk, and the great options it has for supporting its teammates. Despite it acting as a Defogger, separate hazard control remains vital alongside it to maintain its longevity due to its Stealth Rock weakness. Skuntank and Altaria are notable picks, with the former being great for bulky teams that need a Toxic Spikes absorber while also a decent check to stallbreakers like Oricorio-G. Altaria offers good support with its utility and reliability as a Defogger and is able to come in more safely against Eelektross and Combusken and remove hazards. As this set is meant to be used on stall teams, standard stall staples such as Audino and Clefairy are expected to be run alongside it, as they form a core that is vital in providing recovery, Wish passing, spreading Toxic, and blanket checking a majority of threats. These three Pokemon can also all alternate their support options based on the team's needs. Physical tanks such as Regirock, Mudsdale, and Tangela can be quite effective in taking on physical attackers such as Stoutland, Aggron, Lycanroc, and Alolan Raticate. These Pokemon, in general, also appreciate Articuno's ability to check Water-, Ice-, and Grass-type special attackers like Poliwrath, Aurorus, and Bellossom.</p>\n", "abilities": ["Pressure"], "items": ["Leftovers"], "moveslots": [[{"move": "Roost", "type": null}], [{"move": "Defog", "type": null}], [{"move": "Freeze-Dry", "type": null}], [{"move": "Heal Bell", "type": null}, {"move": "Toxic", "type": null}, {"move": "Substitute", "type": null}]], "evconfigs": [{"hp": 248, "atk": 0, "def": 0, "spa": 0, "spd": 204, "spe": 56}], "ivconfigs": [], "natures": ["Calm"]}], "credits": {"teams": [{"name": "Quality checked by", "members": [{"user_id": 202117, "username": "Megazard"}, {"user_id": 247045, "username": "Twix"}, {"user_id": 252106, "username": "yogi"}, {"user_id": 355061, "username": "UberSkitty"}, {"user_id": 400292, "username": "allstarapology"}, {"user_id": 442732, "username": "tondas"}, {"user_id": 434150, "username": "gum"}]}, {"name": "Grammar checked by", "members": [{"user_id": 384270, "username": "martha"}, {"user_id": 302985, "username": "lotiasite"}, {"user_id": 232216, "username": "The Dutch Plumberjack"}, {"user_id": 168392, "username": "P Squared"}, {"user_id": 331519, "username": "CryoGyro"}, {"user_id": 240732, "username": "Estronic"}]}], "writtenBy": [{"user_id": 310340, "username": "Slowbroth"}, {"user_id": 424692, "username": "jklioe"}, {"user_id": 336073, "username": "Rabia"}]}}
